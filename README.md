# q2c-walks

Simulation frameworks for classical, quantum, and hybrid classical-quantum walks on arbitrary networks.

The ``walkerlib'' directory contains definitions of classical and quantum Hamiltonians, analytical solutions of the occupation probability distributions, and numerical integration routines to simulate the evolution of classical, quantum, and hybrid classical-quantum walkers on arbitrary networks.

You can run the examples ``qc_walks.py`` and ``qsw_walks.py``. After running ``qc_walks.py``, you should be able to obtain the following plot:
